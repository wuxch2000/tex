Dear Mr. Greg Johnson

I'm interested in your advertisement posted in LinkedIn for embedded software engineer. 

I have worked in one of the largest telecom company for over 10 years as embedded software development engineer. Most of my development work used C/C++ language under Linux or VxWorks OS. I think my experience of development meet the requirement you ask, and I'm glad to take such challenge if possible.

Attached is my resume about detailed information of me. About relocation, I'm happy for moving to Ottawa if it's needed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely

Jason Wu

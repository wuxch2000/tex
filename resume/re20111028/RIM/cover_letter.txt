Dear David Korbel,

I'm interested in your advertisement posted in LinkedIn for embedded software engineer. 

I have worked in one of the largest telecom company for over 10 years as embedded software development engineer. Most of my development work used C/C++ language under Linux or VxWorks OS. I think my experience of development meet the requirement you ask, and I'm glad to take such challenge if possible.

Plus, I'm a fan for Linux and GNU software such as Emacs, Latex.

Attached is my resume about detailed information of me. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely

Jason Wu

A word of warning: Wrapping gures in LaTex will require a lot of manual adjustment
of your document. There are several packages available for the task, but
none of them work perfectly. Before you make the choice of including gures with
text wrapping in your document, make sure you have considered all the options. For
example, you could use a layout with two columns for your documents and have no
text-wrapping at all.


Although not normally the case in academic writing, an author may prefer that some

than the text width.
